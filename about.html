            <h1><span>Who</span> I am</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Fin. I am an 18 year old college student and I am interested in IT and networking.
                <br>My main focus is on Network engineering and I am currently looking for an apprenticeship in that field.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2><span>What</span> I do</h2>
            <p>I am studying a T level in digital support services at Exeter College. In this course, I look at all aspects of IT.
                <br>This includes cybersecurity, Windows Server, Hardware, Networking, Project management and AWS.
                <br>With this, I hope to be able to get myself an apprenticeship in networking, in turn building my skills.
                <br>I am also currently completing work placement at the NHS as a desktop engineer.
                <br>This involves the diagnosis and repairs of faulty machines, I have also gained
                <br>a lot of experience in enterprise sofware in this role.
