            <h1><span>Who</span> I am</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Fin. I am an 18 year old college student and I am interested in IT and networking.
                <br>My main focus is on Network engineering and I am currently looking for an apprenticeship in that field.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2><span>What</span> I do</h2>
            <p>I currently study a T level in digital support services at Exeter College. In this course, I look at all aspects of IT.
                <br>Also, I'm currently completing work placement for the NHS as a desktop engineer.
                <br>In this role, I have also gained some useful experience in using enterprise hardware and software.
                <br>In my course, I cover cybersecurity, Windows Server, Hardware, Networking, Project management and AWS.
                <br>With all of this, I hope to be able to get myself an apprenticeship in networking, in turn building my skills.
            </p>
            <h3><span>Why</span> I do it</h3>
            <p>From a very young age I have had an obsession with all things technology. This only grew as I got older.
                <br>I always enjoyed taking apart electronics and putting them back together when I was small
                <br>and I never had success with putting things back together which led to a very angry mother.
                <br>Due to this interest in computing, I have taught myself many skills throughout my years of being alive.
                <br>The reason for me doing this is simply pure passion. I love computers and the way that we work with them to complete tasks.
